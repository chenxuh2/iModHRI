actions: 
step near, put, pour, pickup, mix, drink 

objects:
teabag, mug, cup (trash), kettle, tea, water, shaker, sugar, spoon;
box, table 

relations:
(put) into, (put) on, (pour) into, (mix) in, (pickup) from

situation awareness (SA): 
- is tea in the mug? 
- is water boiled? (yes)
- is water in the mug? 

put the information below into a chunk or update via SA (some are changing and some are constant): 
- mug: has tea, has water, has sugar, has spoon (updated as long as 'pour into', 'mix' occur )
- what are being held in the hands? 

constant
- cup: has teabag (initiate with either this or empty)
- shaker: has sugar (starting state)

- model description 
- background draft until current status 
- finish the model by June 5 
- paper deadline is not firm 
- do experiment and paper in parallel

I think one way to build an “observer” model is based on an “actor” model.. 
so the observer is mentally doing the task along with the observer, always asking “what would i do next”? 
The tricky part is that the answer to that is probabilistic and act-r forces a single selection of production rule. 

but you could get do a kind of sample based simulation, where the model simulates next actions for some number of times K and then aggregates statistics.  K is a parameter .. .K= 1 is fast and lazy, K= 10 is slow and cognitively intensive.
